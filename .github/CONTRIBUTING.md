**We welcome contributions of any size and skill level. Contributions can be anything from sharing ideas, to feedback on issues, improvements of documentation, reviews on pull requests, and contributions in code.**

## Project philosophy

When you contribute to Head Start, please make sure you keep [Head Start's philosophy](../README.md#philosophy) in mind.

## Getting started

> [!Note]
> If you're new to contributing, take a look at [first-contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) for helpful information on contributing.

Before spending a lot of your time developing something in code, it's probably a good idea to discuss the details in an issue first. This way you make sure your contribution fits the project and together we come up with the best solutions.

You can follow the [getting started instructions](../docs/getting-started.md). Instead of using this repository as a template, you should fork it as explained in [first-contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions).

## Pull requests

When creating a pull request, the description field will be prefilled with our [pull request template](./PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). Please use it to make it easier for others to review your contribution and get it merged as smoothly as possible.
