# Blocks and Components

**Head Start distinguishes between CMS content related Blocks and regular UI Components.**

## Block and component files

Head Start is based on the Astro project structure (see [Project Structure](./project-structure.md)). Head Start extends the default structure to group blocks next to the regular components:

```
src/
├── blocks/
│   ├── Blocks.astro
│   ├── Blocks.d.ts
│   └── SomeContentBlock/
│       ├── SomeContentBlock.astro
│       └── SomeContentBlock.fragment.graphql
└── components/
    └── SomeUiComponent/
        └── SomeUiComponent.astro
```

- [Components](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/) are the UI elements the website is composed of. This can be Astro and framework specific components.
- Blocks are a specific set of components which have a complementary content [Block](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-modelling/blocks) in DatoCMS and therefore have a paired GraphQL Fragment file.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use `npm run create:block` and `npm run:component` to quickly scaffold a new block or component with their associated files.

See [CMS Data Loading](./cms-data-loading.md) for documentation on the use of GraphQL Fragment files.

## Block templates

Head Start uses the same convention for props and types for every Block: the `Props` interface always contains a `block` property containing the type based on the CMS model. This `block` type is automatically generated based on a Block's GraphQL Fragment file (see [CMS Data Loading](cms-data-loading.md#graphql-files)). This means a basic Block template looks like this:

```astro
---
import type { SomeContentBlockFragment } from '@lib/datocms/types';

interface Props {
  block: SomeContentBlockFragment
}

const { block } = Astro.props;
---

{ block.someContentBlockField }
```

## Modular Blocks

Within the CMS the Blocks are used in [Modular Content](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-modelling/modular-content) and [Structured Text](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-modelling/structured-text) to create dynamic layouts.

Pages and other templates can use the `<Blocks />` component to render a Modular Content or Structured Text field. For example:

```astro
---
import { datocmsRequest } from '@lib/datocms';
import Blocks from '@blocks/Blocks.astro';
import query from './_index.query.graphql';

const { page } = await datocmsRequest({ query, variables: { locale: Astro.params.locale } });
---

<Blocks blocks={page.bodyBlocks} />
```

When you create a new Block, you need to register it in [`blocks/Blocks.astro`](../src/blocks/Blocks.astro) (using the CMS model's typename) and add its type to [`blocks/Blocks.d.ts`](../src/blocks/Blocks.d.ts):

Register a new Block's template:

```astro
---
// src/Blocks/Blocks.astro:

import type { AnyBlock } from './Blocks';
import ImageBlock from './ImageBlock/ImageBlock.astro';
// import your new Block template (order imports A to Z):
import SomeContentBlock from './SomeContentBlock/SomeContentBlock.astro';
import TextBlock from './TextBlock/TextBlock.astro';

const blocksByTypename = {
  ImageBlockRecord: ImageBlock,
  // register your new Block using its CMS model's typename (order A to Z):
  SomeContentBlockRecord: SomeContentBlock,
  TextBlockRecord: TextBlock,
};

interface Props {
  blocks: AnyBlock[];
}
const { blocks } = Astro.props;
```

Register a new Block's type:

```ts
// src/Blocks/Blocks.d.ts:

import {
  ImageBlockFragment,
  // import new Block's Fragment:
  SomeContentBlockFragment,
  TextBlockFragment,
} from '@lib/datocms/types';

export type AnyBlock =
  | ImageBlockFragment
  | SomeContentBlockFragment // and add it here (order A to Z)
  | TextBlockFragment;
```
