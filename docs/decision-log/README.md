# Decision Log

These documents are used to track key decisions that are made during the course of the project. This can be used at a later stage to understand why decisions were made and by whom.

You should add an entry to the decision log if you have:
- Made a decision to use a specific technology which could have significant impact on how folks work in this repo
- Changed a technology that was in use before in favour of a new one
- Made a decision _not_ to use a technology for a specific reason
- Solved a problem in a way which may appear peculiar/confusing without wider context
