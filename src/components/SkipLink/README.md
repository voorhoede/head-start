# Skip Link

**A skip link enables keyboard users and users of assistive technology to jump over parts of the UI that are repeated.**

## Notes

* The skip-link is the first focusable element on the page.
* A skip-link is always an `<a>` pointing to an id of the section it links to.
* The target section must be focusable.
* The label of a skip-link must describe in easy to understand language which section it points to.
