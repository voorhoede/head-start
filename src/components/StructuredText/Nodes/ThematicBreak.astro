// This is a hack: it's important to declare the `node` prop: all the components
// for rendering node types will receive the node at rendering time. That gives
// users of the library the freedom to write custom components with special behaviours based on the
// node specifities. But we don't use the prop in this default block, so the linter
// triggers a warning. At the same time, in Svelte there's no reliable way to disable the
// `svelte(unused-export-let)` warning.
// 
// Mentioning the node like this will silence the warning.
// 
// If you're building a custom component and you're gonna use the node in the component,
// you can omit this statement.
