# Heading Block

**Renders H2-H6 elements with an optional Subtitle**

> [!NOTE]
> This block is most useful to explicitly include a header between other blocks resulting in a more explicit authoring experience. Also, this block is useful for adding Subtitles. When adding Subtitles, pay attention to the DOM Order vs the visual order. Update the component to suite your needs accordingly.

## Features

- Optional `subtitle` field
- `level` field for numbers between 2 and 6
