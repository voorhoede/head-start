# Heading Block

**Renders H2-H6 elements with an optional Sub Heading**

> [!NOTE]
> This block is most useful to explicitly include a header between other blocks resulting in a more explicit authoring experience. Also, this block is useful for adding Sub Headings. When adding Sub Headings, pay attention to the DOM Order vs the visual order. Update the component to suite your needs accordingly.

## Features

- Optional `sub_heading` field
- `level` field for numbers between 2 and 6
