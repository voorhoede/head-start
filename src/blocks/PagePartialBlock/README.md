# Page Partial Block

**Renders one or more reusable page partials, each containing a set of content blocks.**

Each page is composed of blocks. These blocks are unique per page. But sometimes you want to reuse one or more blocks on multiple pages. For example a block to sign up for a newsletter. You only want to make that block once and reuse it on multiple pages. The Page Partial Block enables you to do that: create a page partial containing a set of content blocks and reusing it.

The Page Partial Block also supports different layouts (like an accordion, tabs or plain stack of items) using its `layout` property.

Note: this block is unrelated to [Astro's Page Partial](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-pages/#page-partials) feature.
