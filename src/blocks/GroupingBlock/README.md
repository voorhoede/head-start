# Grouping Block

**Renders multiple blocks and groups them into one**

Blocks are individual components, but sometimes you may want to group them together for better organization and presentation.

The Grouping Block supports various layouts, such as an accordion, tabs, or a plain stack of items, using its `layout` property.
