# Static Sites Commands

All site commands live under `bunny sites`. A site is one storage zone (files) + one pull zone (CDN) with edge rules routing requests to the published deploy, provisioned together by `sites create`. Deploys are immutable directories; promoting or rolling back retargets an edge rule and purges the cache; no files move, so it's instant.

Most commands accept an optional site (a trailing `[site]` positional, or the `--site` flag on commands whose positionals are taken, like `deploy`). When omitted, the site resolves in this order:

1. Explicit name or storage zone ID
2. `.bunny/site.json` manifest (written by `bunny sites link` or `bunny sites create`)
3. `sites.name` in `bunny.jsonc`
4. Interactive prompt (suppressed in `--output json` mode, and on destructive commands run with `--force`; pass a site or link the directory in CI)

Commands that can link the directory (`deploy`, `show`, `deployments list/publish`, `ci init`) take `--link`/`--no-link`: the picker prompts unless the flag decided it, and an explicit `--link` also links a site resolved from a ref or from `bunny.jsonc`, including under `--output json`. The other site commands never write the manifest and don't take the flag.

## Typical workflows

```bash
# New site: provision, deploy, iterate
bunny sites create my-site                 # served at https://sites-my-site-<suffix>.b-cdn.net
bunny sites deploy ./dist                  # deploy and publish as the live site

# Build-and-deploy in one step (build command from bunny.jsonc or the flag)
bunny sites deploy --build                 # runs `sites.build`, deploys `sites.dir`
bunny sites deploy ./out --build "npm run build"

# Rollback
bunny sites deployments list               # find the deploy ID (● Live marks production)
bunny sites deployments publish --previous --force   # instant rollback
bunny sites deployments publish a1b2c3d4 --force     # promote a specific deploy

# Custom production domain (optional)
bunny sites domains add example.com --wait # production vanity hostname + SSL
```

## Deploying is publishing

This is the rule that shapes every other command here:

- Every `deploy` becomes the live site. There is no separate preview URL and no unpublished deploy.
- Deploys stay immutable under their own ID, so `deployments publish <id>` rolls back to any earlier one by retargeting the edge rule; no files move and nothing is re-uploaded.
- Custom domains are vanity hostnames on the site's pull zone; without one the site serves at `https://sites-<name>-<suffix>.b-cdn.net`.

Content is root-served, so root-absolute assets work as-is. Single-page apps get `index.html` for extensionless misses when the detected framework is client-routed (Vite, CRA, React Router, Angular, Vue CLI, Ember, Preact) and the output has no root `404.html`; `sites.spa` in `bunny.jsonc` or `--spa`/`--no-spa` on the deploy decides explicitly, and otherwise a root `404.html` is the not-found page. The mode is recorded per deploy and follows rollbacks. Deploys are not individually addressable: `/deploys/<id>/` URLs are internal to the storage layout and are not publicly served. To review a change before it goes live, build and serve it locally, or deploy it to a separate site.

## Deploy IDs

- The deploy ID is the **git short-sha** when the working tree is clean, otherwise a 12-char **content hash**. Re-deploying identical content is a no-op (`--force` overrides).
- `--deploy-id <id>` sets the ID yourself, so a deploy can carry the same identifier as whatever produced it (a release tag, a catalog build, a timestamped artifact) and `deployments list` needs no cross-referencing. The ID is used **exactly as given**, case included: it exists to match your identifier, and it never appears in a client-facing URL (the edge rule builds the origin path from it server-side). IDs become storage paths, so they take letters, digits and `-`, `_` or `.`, 4 to 64 characters, starting and ending alphanumeric: `20260827-1433-r42`, `Catalog_V3`, `v1.2.3`.
  - Deploy IDs are therefore **case-sensitive**. `publish`/`delete` match exactly and suggest a case variant when one exists, and deploying an ID that differs from an existing one only in case is refused (not even with `--force`), since two storage paths differing only by case are indistinguishable to anything that folds case.
  - An explicit ID is an assertion about identity, so it is never aliased onto an earlier deploy that happens to share content: each release keeps its own ID and rollback target even when the bytes are unchanged.
  - Reusing an ID for **different** content asks before replacing, because rolling back to that ID would then serve the new files instead of the originals (`--force` skips the prompt for CI). A replacement clears the old files first, so nothing stale survives. The **live deploy and the rollback target are never replaceable in place** (not even with `--force`): that would empty and rewrite the files being served. Deploy under a new ID, or publish another deploy first.
  - The git sha is still recorded alongside a custom ID when the deploy came from a repo, so provenance is not lost; `deployments list` shows it as `custom (git abc12345)`.
- Dotfiles and `node_modules` are never uploaded.

## `bunny sites create`; Provision a site

```bash
bunny sites create                         # uses `sites.name` from bunny.jsonc, else prompts (directory-name suggestion), then a custom domain
bunny sites create my-site
bunny sites create my-site --region NY
bunny sites create my-site --tier ssd       # Edge (SSD) storage, always DE
bunny sites create my-site --domain example.com
bunny sites create my-site --no-link       # don't write .bunny/site.json
```

| Flag       | Description                                                                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--region` | Main storage region code (default `DE`)                                                            |
| `--tier`   | Storage tier: `hdd` (Standard) or `ssd` (Edge, always `DE`); create-time only                      |
| `--domain` | Attach a custom production domain after provisioning; interactive runs prompt for one when omitted |
| `--link`   | Link this directory (default true; `--no-link` to skip)                                            |

Site names are 3-47 lowercase letters, digits, and dashes. The storage zone, pull zone, and b-cdn.net subdomain become `sites-<name>-xxxxxx` (a `sites-` prefix marking them in the dashboard, plus a shared random suffix since zone names are global across bunny.net); commands still take the clean site name. Creation is idempotent; a failed create re-runs cleanly, reusing whatever was already provisioned.

---

## `bunny sites deploy`; Deploy a directory

```bash
bunny sites deploy ./dist                  # deploy and publish as the live site
bunny sites deploy --build                 # run `sites.build` from bunny.jsonc first
bunny sites deploy ./out --build "npm run build" --env VITE_FLAG=1
```

| Flag         | Description                                                          |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[dir]`      | Directory to deploy (default: `sites.dir` in bunny.jsonc, then cwd)  |
| `--build`    | Run a build first (bare flag: `sites.build`, else a detected build)  |
| `--env`      | Build-time env override `KEY=VALUE` (repeatable; requires `--build`) |
| `--env-file` | Dotenv file of build-time overrides (requires `--build`)             |
| `--force`    | Deploy even when content is unchanged                                |
| `--site`     | Target site (name or storage zone ID)                                |
| `--link`     | Link this directory to the deployed site (`--no-link` never links)   |

With `--build`, the build runs in your shell environment plus the `--env`/`--env-file` overrides; there is no remote env store; put build-time values in your local `.env` or CI secrets. Redeploying content that is already uploaded skips the upload and just republishes it; when it is already live, the deploy is a no-op unless you pass `--force`.

Interactive `deploy` adds two conveniences (both skipped under `--output json`):

- **No linked site** → it offers to create a new site or pick an existing one, then links it (goes straight to create when the account has no sites).
- **No `--build`** → it offers to run a build first: the configured `sites.build`, else a detected framework build (same detection as `ci init`), else a `package.json` `build` script. Confirming builds first, and when no `[dir]` was given it deploys the framework's output directory.
- **A domainless site's first deploy** → it offers to attach a custom production domain (blank skips) and runs the same DNS/SSL flow as `sites domains add`; it asks only once per site, and every later domainless deploy just prints a one-line `sites domains add` hint.

## `bunny sites deployments`; List, publish, prune, delete

```bash
bunny sites deployments list
bunny sites deployments publish a1b2c3d4    # confirm prompt; --force to skip
bunny sites deployments publish --previous  # instant rollback
bunny sites deployments prune --keep 10     # never prunes current/previous
bunny sites deployments prune my-site       # or --site my-site
bunny sites deployments delete a1b2c3d4 --force   # delete one deploy
```

`publish` (alias `promote`) flips production to a past deploy; the files are already on the CDN, so this is instant plus a cache purge.

`delete` removes a single deploy: its files and its record. The live deploy and the rollback target are refused (`--force` only skips the confirmation), and deleting an ID that's already gone is a no-op success, so re-runs converge. `--output json` prints `{ site, id, deleted }`. For retention cleanup, use `prune`.

---

## `bunny sites domains`; Custom domains

```bash
bunny sites domains add example.com --wait  # wait for DNS, then issue SSL
bunny sites domains ssl example.com         # issue a certificate later
bunny sites domains list
bunny sites domains remove example.com
```

A custom domain is the site's production URL and nothing more. The first added domain is recorded as the production URL. If the domain is on a Bunny DNS zone in the account, the CLI offers to create the record; if its nameservers already point at bunny.net without a zone in the account, it offers to create the zone first (shared flow in `core/hostnames/flow.ts`, so scripts and storage domains behave the same); otherwise it prints the CNAME target. The CLI verifies a certificate actually landed on the exact hostname before forcing HTTPS or reporting success, and probes the domain over TLS afterwards, so a mismatched certificate (e.g. shadowed by another zone's wildcard) warns instead of printing a broken URL. Re-running `bunny sites domains add <domain>` after a partial setup reconciles the remaining steps instead of failing on the already-attached hostname.

---

## `bunny sites ci init`; GitHub Actions deployments

```bash
bunny sites ci init                         # detect the framework, write .github/workflows/bunny-sites.yml
bunny sites ci init --framework astro       # skip detection (astro, vite, react-router, next, sveltekit, vitepress, docusaurus, eleventy, jekyll, hugo, static)
bunny sites ci init --site my-site --force  # overwrite an existing workflow
```

Writes a workflow using the `BunnyWay/actions/deploy-site` action with the site name baked in: pushes to `main` go live, plus `workflow_dispatch` for on-demand redeploys. Deploys serialize and are never cancelled in flight, since cancelling mid-upload would leave a half-written deploy directory behind. `sites.dir` and `sites.build` from `bunny.jsonc` override the preset's deploy directory and build command, so CI builds and deploys exactly what a local `sites deploy` does. The workflow is written at the git root; when `bunny.jsonc` lives below it (a monorepo package), the job gets `defaults.run.working-directory` and the deploy directory is prefixed, so those paths still mean what they do locally. Framework detection reads `package.json` dependencies, `Gemfile`, or Hugo config; the lockfile picks the package manager for the install steps. The job requests `contents: read` and `deployments: write`, so the run is recorded in the repository's Environments. After writing, the CLI offers to run `gh secret set BUNNYNET_API_KEY` (or prints the manual steps). `sites create` offers the same scaffold on GitHub repos; declining prints the workflow instead.

## `bunny sites` lifecycle and maintenance

```bash
bunny sites list
bunny sites show                            # resources, domains, current deploy
bunny sites open                            # open the live URL in the browser (--print emits it)
bunny sites ssl --no-force-ssl              # toggle Force HTTPS on the site's b-cdn.net system host
bunny sites link my-site                    # .bunny/site.json
bunny sites unlink
bunny sites delete my-site                  # typed-name confirmation; --keep-storage keeps files
```

## `bunny.jsonc` integration

An optional `sites` block configures the deploy defaults (validated on its own, so a sites-only file works without an `app` block):

```jsonc
{
  "sites": {
    "name": "my-site", // resolves the site when nothing is linked
    "dir": "./dist", // default deploy directory
    "build": "npm run build", // command for `deploy --build`
  },
}
```

## CI / agents

- Pass `--force` on anything with a confirmation (publish, prune, remove, delete); without a TTY they error with a hint rather than waiting on a prompt.
- Pass the site explicitly (or commit `bunny.jsonc` with `sites.name`); the interactive picker is disabled under `--output json` and by `--force`, so `sites delete --force` with nothing linked errors instead of prompting.
- `--output json` on every command emits machine-readable results. `deploy` prints `{ id, production, unchanged, live }`, where `production` is `null` on a site whose hostname couldn't be read.
- The first-deploy custom-domain prompt never runs under `--output json` or without a TTY, so CI deploys are unaffected.
